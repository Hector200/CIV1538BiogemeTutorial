    "Python is a general purpose programming language, which is popular among data scientists and includes a variety of useful packages for Transportation Demand Analysts. It is an interpretative language, rather than compiled, so can run slightly slower in CPU time. However, its ease of use means it often takes less time in learning and coding.\n",

    "Make sure you download a version that includes Python 3.7+ (required by Biogeme). This should be the default distribution provided with Anaconda. During the installation process, make sure that it is selected to 'Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable' and 'Register Anaconda as my default Python 3.x'\n",

Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type. Python lists are mutable - meaning individual elements of a list can be changed."

You can use Pylab feature in ipython notebook (ipython notebook –pylab = inline) to use these plotting features inline.
